### What I've Learnt:
- Arrays, Stacks/Queues, Hash Tables/Maps, Linked Lists (Singly & Doubly), Trees, Graphs
- Recursion, Sorting, Searching, Breadth Search First, Depth First Search (In-Order, Pre-Order and Post-Order) and Dynamic Programming

<br />

### What I've Done & Will Accomplish:
I've attempted to implement everything in 2 languages: Python and JavaScript.
I'll continue to refactor my code and implement more in JavaScript as right now, the majority of code is still in Python for less verbage.
